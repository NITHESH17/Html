    <h3>Corona tips</h3>
       <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
         1. Clean your hands often.</br>
         2. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</br>
         3. Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</br>
         4. Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</br>
         5. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</br>
         6. Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</br>
         7. Stay home if you feel unwell.</br>
         8. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</br>
         9. Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</br>
     Masks
     Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>

  <h2>Corona is Danger</h2>
       <p>Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.</p>
